OWASP GTU-Graduate school of Engineering and Technology was founded in August 2021. We are a group of technical skilled college students on a mission to disseminate the Cyber Awareness to our societies, and Sharpening up Cyber security skills for our Students of GTU-GSET! The chapter presents many opportunities to the software community to secure application development, Web/App Security, Penetration Testing, Bug Bounty, Ethical Hacking and many more. Join our enthusiastic team to make Cyber Space a Better Place!
